# Word-Guess-Game
This is a Star Wars theme word guessing game. The user will try type letter between a-z and guess the name of the character. The game keeps track how many times a user guesses correctly or incorrectly. After the user guesses correctly, a voice of the character or related to the word will play.

There are two index.html files, the index.html uses the wordgame.js script and the index_object.html uses the wordgame_object.js. The wordgame_object.js uses the Object game to run the Word guess game.
